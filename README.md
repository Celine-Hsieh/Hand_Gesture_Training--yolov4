## Purpose

* issue 
    1. To improve the serious shortage of labor in Taiwan’s construction industry
    2. To solve the problem that laborers are unwilling to do a lot of rough work (eg: nailing templates, cutting templates, tying steel bars, etc.)

* Solution 
    1. Use robotic arms to replace manpower, and replace a lot of manual work by controlling the robotic arm and designing its operation script.
    2. Use the advantage that the mechanical arm can lift heavier objects to solve the situation of rough labor without human resources.

## Situational application

1. Building materials wholesale factory environment

    * Robotic Arm Handling system --- Speech Recognition
    
        > In the first situation，since the hands of the workers need to do other tasks during the handling process in the factory, it is inconvenient for the hands to move. Therefore, in this case, voice recognition can be used to instruct the robotic arm to move the building materials, and carry them back and forth between two points.

2. Construction site environment

    * Robotic Arm Construction System --- Gesture Recognition
    
        > In the second situation，when the scene is a relatively noisy construction site environment, because the sound cannot be well received, gesture recognition can be used to execute the written script in this situation, such as the path of stacking bricks.
